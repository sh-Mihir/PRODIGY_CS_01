# PRODIGY_CS_01
This is my task number - 1 of my Cyber Security internship at Prodigy InfoTech.

Welcome to the Caesar Cipher Program! This Python program allows users to encrypt and decrypt text using the classic Caesar Cipher algorithm. The Caesar Cipher is a type of substitution cipher in which each letter in the plaintext is shifted a certain number of places down or up the alphabet. This program enables you to input a message and a shift value (key) to perform both encryption and decryption.

Features
--> Encryption: Convert your plaintext message into ciphertext by shifting the letters forward in the alphabet by the specified key value.
--> Decryption: Convert your ciphertext message back into plaintext by shifting the letters backward in the alphabet by the specified key value.
--> Handles non-alphabetic characters: Spaces, numbers, and punctuation are preserved in the encrypted and decrypted messages.
